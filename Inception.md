D1. Inception

1. Introduction

  Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the 
University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others 
and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as 
connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience 
that much better.

  Interviewee 9:
  Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview?
   - Parker Marschel, junior studying computer science at NAU
  When?
    - February 15, 2020
  Consumer Segment
    - Parker is a upperclassmen
    - He believed our best consumer segment would be the incoming freshman especially those coming from out of state
    - Also for foreign exchange students, they’d be able to meet other students easier
  Key Insights
    - He believed that upperclassmen would probably use it more for making study groups and that a messaging service would be a               necessity.
  Representative Quotes
    - “Being able to message other students based on the same interests or clubs would be a very useful tool for newer students to the       college”
  Hypotheses that were validated
  - His views on the Consumer segment matched our hypothesis
  Assesment
    - Nice to Have
      - Wouldn’t be a necessity for Parker but he views as if when he was a freshman he probably would of tried it out. But that he             didnt absolutely need it.
